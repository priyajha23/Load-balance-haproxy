# Load Balancer with HAProxy and Golang Services

## Overview

This project sets up a load balancer using **HAProxy** to distribute traffic between two **Golang services** running in separate **Docker** containers. The services are managed using Docker, and round-robin load balancing is implemented via HAProxy.
